Unlinking Orbit from Zenko
==========================

During product familiarization and solution development, it may be necessary
to unlink a Zenko instance from Orbit. To do this:

#. Click the **Settings** button in the sidebar.

#. Click the **Unlink this Zenko Instance** button.

#. Click **Forget** to confirm.

Orbit's association with the Zenko instance is broken. To connect
Orbit to another Zenko instance or reconnect it to the forgotten
instance, follow the steps in :ref:`Setting Up a Full Orbit Installation
<setting_up_orbit>`.
