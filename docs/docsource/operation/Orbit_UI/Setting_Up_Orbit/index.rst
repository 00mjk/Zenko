Setting Up Orbit
================

Orbit is a web-based graphical user interface that simplifies Zenko operations.
You can set up Orbit in a sandbox demo mode or as a registered instance. Once
Orbit is configured, you can unlink it from a Zenko instance as well.

Registering Orbit to Zenko
--------------------------

Orbit can be run as a user interface to Zenko no matter where or how Zenko is
hosted. You can deploy Zenko on any host running Kubernetes 1.11.3 or
later. Successfully tested Kubernetes hosts include:

-  A test instance running on a local machine using Minikube
-  A cloud host using MetalK8s
-  A cloud host using the hostâ€™s native Kubernetes environment (EKS, GKE, AKS).
