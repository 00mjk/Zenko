Delete a Bucket
===============

**Prerequisite:** The bucket must be empty.

   .. note::

      If the bucket has versioning enabled, and if it contains any versioned
      objects, you will have to run scripts to empty the bucket of all
      objects. See :ref:`Deleting Versioned Objects`.

To delete a bucket:

#. Click **Browser** in the sidebar to open the **Multicloud Browser**:
