## The connection values are used to connect Backbeat to the queue and quorum. They are
## automatically templated with the designate release name(e.g. When installed with release
## name 'dev-testing', the queue would get templated to 'dev-testing-zenko-queue:9092').
## The external option is for specifying an external queue and quorum outside the scope of kubernetes
connection:
  queue: 'zenko-queue:2181'
  quorum: 'zenko-quorum:9092'
  external: false
## Environment variables global to all backbeat pods

    # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious

    # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
    # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
