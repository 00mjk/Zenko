Zenko is  [Scality](http://www.scality.com/)â€™s Open Source Multi-Cloud Data Controller.

Zenko's goal is to provide a unifed namespace, access API and search capabilities to data stored locally using Docker volumes or Scality RING or in public cloud storage services like [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3), or [Microsoft Azure Blob storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/).

## Overview

This repository includes installation resources to deploy the full Zenko
stack over different orchestration systems.

Currently we have [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).

### Zenko Stack

The stack is composed of:
- [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)
- [Zenko Cloudserver](https://github.com/scality/S3)
- [Zenko Backbeat Async Replication Engine](https://github.com/scality/backbeat)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [redis](https://redis.io/)
- all magically configured to talk to each other.
